# About

LocalizaHC was a React project created for the MC855 discipline in the first semester of 2022. The members of the group are André Luis Romão Gouvêa, Enrico Delbuono, Felipe Tiago Martins Arruda and Lucas Roberto de Souza.

The objective of the project was to create a solution for a problem that happens on the pediatric outpatient clinic of the clinical Hospital of the State University of Campinas (Hospital das Clínicas da Unicamp): basically, due to the large flow of patients throughout the day and the lack of informations for them, many pacients end up on the wrong places or not doing what they need. This cause lots of delay and stress both for the pacients and the crew of the clinic, who end up having to perform other functions to direct these people.

To solve this problem, we created a Progressive Web App that aims to perform like a chatbot and guide the patient through their journey in the clinic, letting them know where they need to be when they need to be and informing the staff of the hospital which patients are in the waiting queue ready to be called.

# Prototype

Before developing the project, we created a high fidelity prototype, which can be accessed on Figma:

# Libs used

To develop this project, these libs were used:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/pt/)
- [React Simple Chatbot](https://lucasbassetti.com.br/react-simple-chatbot/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
